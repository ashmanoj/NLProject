# NLProject

In this project I want to use headlines of Apple to see if its sentiment can bw used to trade. 
We have a column in the dataset which has the headline, and will use NLP techniques to create a new column with a sentiment 0, 1, or 2.
We can use sentiment along with other columns to see if we can predict either 0(sell/don't buy) or 1 (buy)

We will also train/test split the data and then do it on the testing set to see if close price was higher than open price
